> Anaconda is a distribution of packages built for data science. It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. You'll be using conda to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions of Python and/or different packages. You'll also use it to install, uninstall, and update packages in your environments. Using Anaconda has made my life working with data much more pleasant.  --- Udacity
